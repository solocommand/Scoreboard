Scoreboard
===========

Scoreboard (formerly TitanPoints) is an interface add-on for World of Warcraft that displays in-game currency amounts. This addon now uses LibDataBroker, which means you can use it with your favorite LDB display (such as [Titan Panel](https://www.titanpanel.org), [ChocolateBar](https://github.com/Kiatra/ChocolateBar), [ElvUI](https://www.tukui.org), and many more!)
